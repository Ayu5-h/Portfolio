        Hello, ðŸ‘‹ <br />
        As an engineering student, my passion for technology and programming 
        is matched only by my drive to turn that passion into practical skills 
        in real world. Through my studies,  I have gained experience in programming languages 
        such as Python, C++ and java. I have also developed skills in Software development methodologies, 
        Machine Learning, Cloud  computing, Database management, and Web & App development. 
        I especially take pride in my apptitude and researching skills. 
        <br />
        <br />
        My ability to learn quickly and to collaborate effectively makes me a valuable asset 
        to any team or organisation, may that be as a individual or as a contributor. 
        I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a challenging role in the software development industry, 
        where I can continue to learn and grow as a professional, as well as increase my skillset.
